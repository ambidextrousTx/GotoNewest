#GotoNewest

A small tool to directly change directory into the newest
directory created in any base directory. It reads the base
directory from a configuration file.

To run, just fill out the config file that contains the base
(parent) directory, and then run

**$ gn**

Of course, you need to make the _gn_ script executable and put
it in your path.
